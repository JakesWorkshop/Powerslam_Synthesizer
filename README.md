# Powerslam_Synthesizer
This is a collection of code and files related to my modular Synthesizer

Powerslam is a modular Synthesizer made by someone with no actual music knowledge.
It's meant for people who want explore modular synths and those who want to have fun building these things.
Most modules will be based on Arduino compatible hardware to make them much easier to build,
taking the approach of direct digital synthesis instead of fully analog Hardware.
